gamby.tools README
==================

This repository contains software tools for the creation of content
for the GAMBY LCD/Game shield. 


Processing/CharEdit/
====================

This is a [http://processing.org/ Processing] sketch for the GAMBY font
editing tool. It contains its own usage documentation.

Each character image in the GAMBY font is 32 bits. Bits 0-24 form a 5x5 pixel 
bitmap (by column); bits 25-27 are the character's vertical offset (so
descenders actually descend, etc.); and bits 28-31 are the character's
width.


Python/gamby.py
===============

This is a tool for converting image files to and from GAMBY code.
The file, gamby.py, can either be used as a command-line tool or imported 
into Python as a package for use in your own code.
